/*:
 Let's take what we just saw and put it into a single game.
 
 ## AR Rock Paper Scissors!
 
 On the right is a view where you can play rock paper scissors with a machine player.
 
 You can choose between **Markov** and **Psychological** models which uses statistics or psychology.
 
 You can realistically experience how satistical model and psychological model stacks up against you! By competing with a machine that uses both mind game and numbers game, you will be able to improve your RPS skills! ðŸ˜Ž
 
 Once you start the game, you will have 3 seconds to choose your choice with your hand. You can find the win ratio in the top right and top left side of the view!
 
 Have fun :)
 
 - Note: Are you running out of time? If so, quickly wrap up on this view and please proceed to the next page. I added this game at the end of the project so that you can play it later :)
